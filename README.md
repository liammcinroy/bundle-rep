# Fiber Bundle State Representations

This repo contains implementations (currently WIP) of fiber bundle state
representations. A current version of the whitepaper describing the methods
and their theory will be available soon.

## Setup

Implementations are provided in Python3 with Jupyter notebooks. To ensure you
have the proper packages, we recommend using pip with venv. Then, setup is as
easy as creating a new virtual environment at this directory with the command

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

in the main directory, and then calling

```
python3 -m pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```
